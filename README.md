## Project 🚧
One of the main pain point that AT\&T users are facing is constant exposure to SPAM messages.

AT\&T has been able to manually flag spam messages for a time, but they are looking for an automated way of detecting spams to protect their users.

## Goals 🎯
Your goal is to build a spam detector, that can automatically flag spams as they come based solely on the sms' content.

## Dataset 🖼️
Here is the dataset: https://full-stack-bigdata-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/Deep+Learning/project/spam.csv
